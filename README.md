## Reason Remote Codec for ICON QConProG2 (Mackie Controller Clone)

QConProG2 is a nice DAW controller at reasonable price. Unfortunately, like most Mackie Controller clones, also the QConProG2 only supports the standardized functionality of the underlying protocol that is MCU. Imho, MCU was nice but does match the different abilities of modern DAWs anymore. There is so much more one could do with this kind of hardware and MCU is limited in it's definition.

This results in the situation, that the buttons and encoders don't match for nearly any DAW anymore. Added the fact, that every DAW manufacturer has different mappings of functions to the MCU functions and controller manufacturers usually only ship with an overlay of the mapped functions for your DAW, no matter if the mapped functions make sense or not, one is forced to rearrange the mappings to your own needs. Of course, if you do that, you can't use the overlays anymore (sigh).

To overcome this situation, I decided to recode the mackie codec, which comes with Reason and implement the mappings the way I seem fit for Reason.  As Reason itself is limited regarding the so called 'remotable items', so things like Mark/Cut/Paste don't make sense.
